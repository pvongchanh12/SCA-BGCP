Generative Art: Intro to Code is a class offered by StreetCode Academy, a tech education nonprofit based in East Palo Alto, CA.

I was an instructor for the class in Summer 2022, but the curriculum isn't getting pushed because that would be illegal (yes, it's scattered).

A student gave me permission to share this assignment submission!
