Generative Art: Intro to Code is a class offered by StreetCode Academy, a tech education nonprofit based in East Palo Alto, CA. Check us out at streetcode.org!

I was an instructor for the class in Summer 2022, but the curriculum isn't getting pushed because that would be illegal (yes, it's scattered and I don't need to organize them yet).

A student gave me permission to share this assignment submission! I highly recommend running the code--it's so cool.
